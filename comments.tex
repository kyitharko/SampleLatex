\section*{My Impression}
I was really impressed about listening this lecture. I have watched documentries for such kind of things. But this is my first time that I have listened to the lecture about space from a professor who is perticipating in the real world project. This is very tough job for the participants of this kind of projects. All people may feel a high pressure. I thought that the equipments used in the satellite are high performance machines and only such kind of high performance CPU, Memory and etc., can operate the operation in the space. But my thought was wrong. The low performance device should be used because of the heat produced by the equipments. This is really impressed to me.
