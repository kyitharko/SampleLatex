\section*{Interesting Part}
The most interesting thing for me about this lecture is how to send much data using such low data transfer rate. The other thing is implementing the space simulator that can support for the researchers with low budget. The final interesting thing is software implementation that can operate in very low performance hardware that is used in the space system.
